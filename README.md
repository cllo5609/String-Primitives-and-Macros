# String-Primitives-and-Macros

This program takes in ten signed integers from the user. Values are stored
as strings. Each input is validated to make sure it fits into a 32-bit register and is a signed integer.
The integer is then converted from string form into decimal form. Once in decimal form the sum,
and average are calculated and stored in memory. Finally, the stored integers are converted
back into ascii characters and the list of entered integers, the sum, and the average are
displayed. The program uses Macros to gather input and display input. Conversions are done using
string primitives.
